# Stigma-Health-Records-Blockchain

Confidential Health Records for Stigma Diseased Patients using Blockchain  

Project Overview: This repository contains the source code and documentation for a major project titled "Confidential Health Records for Stigma Diseased Patients using Blockchain," approved and sponsored by KSCST (Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology). The project addresses critical concerns related to the security and privacy of health records, user data ownership, and data integrity within the healthcare industry.  

Key Features:  

Blockchain Technology: The system leverages blockchain to ensure the security and immutability of health records, safeguarding the integrity of patients' information. 

Precise Access Controls: Patients have greater authority over their electronic health records through precise access controls, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and breaches of confidentiality. 

User Registration and Confidential Key: Patients need to register and generate a confidential key using provided credentials to access the system, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access private health information.

Project Implications: The proposed solution carries significant implications for the healthcare industry by providing a secure and unchangeable platform for storing health records. The incorporation of blockchain technology adds an extra layer of security, addressing the challenges associated with data security and integrity. 

How to Use:  Clone the repository to your local machine. Follow the documentation for setting up and running the system.
